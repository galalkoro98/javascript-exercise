## The Mission: 
We have gotten a request to make a website for a client. The client had a lot to say about it, but basically it boils down to a webshop / ebay kind of thing.

As this is your first experience working with SCRUM, let's start off with an introduction by your coach. After that it's time to get cracking! The client will brief you about what the project is and which features they require. Pay attention to what they have to say and ask questions if something is not clear. It will be essential to make up an MVP ASAP, as we don't have a lot of time for a project on this scale.

Make sure you get information from the client to what is important and what is nice to have. You cannot go up to your client for each small question you have about the project. Also make sure to update your client if certain features will not be implemented due to lack of time. What's important is that you get the must-have requirements and scrap as many nice-to-haves that you need to do so.

## Rules:
Since your coach will be playing the client while being your coach, we need to define some rules.

- Your coach does not know what the client wants, they cannot tell you, you need to ask the client.
- You have a call with your client each week to update them on how things are going.
- You can send the client an email, but it might take a while to respond, so be sure you have all the info you need from them.
- For programming related problems, your coach is still there. 

## Must have requirements:
- Use SCRUM as a team
    - As a SCRUM master, you will manage the tickets, who wants to do what and how long will it take to complete the tickets
    - The SCRUM master will be helping the team so that everyone is comfortable while getting all the must-haves the client wants
    - The SCRUM master will initiate a daily stand up
    - The SCRUM master will initiate a weekly sprint and sprint retrospect
    - As a team member, you will be communicating to your SCRUM master so that they know which tickets you prefer and how long they take.
  
- At the start of the project, make user stories. Based on those stories, make tickets. Use whatever ticketing system you prefer.
    - Add screenshots of your user stories and tickets to a folder on your repository in a separate screenshot folder.
  
- Make up an MVP for the project, a list of all requirements you have to achieve.
    - Put this list in the README of your project.
    - If the client is not happy with the result, and you completed the MVP, that means your MVP was made incorrectly.
    - The client HAS to be happy!
  
## Nice to have features:
Ask the client! I'm sure they have a lot of features that will be impossible to be made in 2 weeks.

## May the gods be with you

Teamwork makes the dreamwork! ü§ù
