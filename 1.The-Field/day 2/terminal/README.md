# Terminal

Welcome to the *terminal*, do each of the following challenges to learn how to
survive within the command line.

These short exercises are made for Unix systems, meaning Linux and Mac will easily tag along. For people using Windows, we recommend installing [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Go ahead and open your terminal and dive into the exercises! Below I'll help you out with opening it on each OS.

##Windows

You should have git bash installed. Press the windows key and type "git bash". Here you can open it.

##Ubuntu

Most ubuntu versions have an easy right click -> open terminal feature. If not, you can use the command CTRL+ALT+T to open a Terminal.

##Mac

CMD+SPACEBAR will open the quick search field, type terminal and open it!
