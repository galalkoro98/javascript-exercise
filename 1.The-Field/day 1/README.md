# Becode: Getting started

To get this all flowing in the right direction, we need you to set up a couple things. Let's jump right into it.

### We need some information:

Fill in this typeform:

https://becode.typeform.com/to/ltkjYW

### Discord

This is our general communication tool. We will also organise our classes remotely on this platform. Go ahead and make an account on the url below and download the application.

https://discord.com/

### GitHub

This is where your projects will live, you will also need GitHub to get access to all the exercises and material we provide. Go ahead and make an account!

### IDE

An IDE is basically a text editor in which you can write your code. You can choose whichever one you like, however your coaches will be working with the JetBrains IDE. Normally these are only available through paid subscriptions, but with the URL from below you can unlock it for free during the course.

### MyBecode

MyBecode is a platform we made to manage our classes and learners. The main reason you are obliged to use this platform is for your attendances. You will be able to log in to MyBecode once everyone has completed the typeform.

### All done?

Let your coach know you're done!
