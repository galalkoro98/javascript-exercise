## The mission 

- Invent a company together and think of 1 page per person in your team, that the company needs.
- Divide those pages amongst the group and each person designs one page.
- Once you are all finished, join those pages together with some form of navigation
- Publish the result with a github repository (call it `name-of-your-business`)
- Make sure everyone in the group has a fork of the website
- Explain your company in the readme of the repo and put a link to the company 'website' in there
- Add a parallax image header [Example](https://demo.athemes.com/themes/?theme=Sydney)
- Add a carousel on one page
- Make your website responsive
- Mention your phone number on any of the pages, in the a tag add tel in the href. (it can be a fake number)
- Have a contact form, add a fake email in the mailto property.

You can use bootstrap or SASS, but you are not required to use it. 
However use of these tools will give you extra credit in the evaluation.

You can choose the make the website in Dutch or English.
