# Title: One more round on the Carousel!

## The Mission
Implement the layout at the bottom as good as possible, you can search for your own images to use in the layout.
Make sure you have a working carousel using [the bootstrap component](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/carousel/) when you click on the arrows of the top.
Publish your result.

Not having the exact layout is not the worst, a carousel is a must have though! We recommend you start from top to bottom recreating this.
