# Welcome to css frameworks !

From bootstrap to materialize, the world has lots of css frameworks, but what is a `CSS Framework`?

## The what

A CSS Framework is basically a great library of CSS properties applied to general classes.
It allows you to both create and fasten the UI for a website.

## The why 

Well, imagine you need a grid, filled with squares, each square has an icon in there and is clickable,
you want that grid to be responsive as well. You are propably able to create that, but how long would that take you?
Now imagine for a second, that you have a ready set list of classes that you can use to create this, 
without writing any CSS code... Once you would know these classnames, you would probably do this assignment in 1/10th of the time...

## Before you start

A very nice benefit of bootstrap is that it is more than a CSS framework, it also comes with some often used Javascript components like a carousel, tabs, ...

During your training at BeCode you will use the bootstrap libary, but feel free to play around with other frameworks.
The more you know the better!

## Installation guide for bootstrap
