# Settings

Settings allow you to set things on your site such as name, site address, date format, language, permalinks...

See if the settings are right for you before you start the theme.
 

### Reading

This is where we determine whether our site is a blog or a simple site (static page). In the latter case, you must designate a home page, it will be linked to the `front-page.php` template.

Also set the max number of items to display.

### Permalinks

This is where you determine the form that takes the name of your url.

### Plugins to be adjusted

Some plugin features are regulated in this part. Remember to take a look at them.
