# Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)

## Introduction

This is an important chapter for the implementation of your future project.

I've already talked about it in [**the plugins**](../06.plugins.md) section. [ACF](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) is a plugin very used by WordPress developers.

It allows you to create custom fields. 

For example:
- text fields with or without text editor
- of lists
- of images
- of image galleries
- of links
- date picker
- integrate Goolge maps or OpenStreetMap
- flexible content
- ...

See the list of possibilities [here](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/).

### What does it do?

This is used to customize the CMS part for your client to help them fill out their content.
A customer who can easily update his site, is a happy customer and a happy customer... Well, thatâ€™s pretty cool!


## Installation

We will use the PRO version to have all the features.

Take the **advanced-custom-fields-pro** folder and copy it to `/wp-content/plugins`.

Yes the PRO version, because thanks to **BeCode**, you are entitled to the ACF PRO license!

The license key : `b3JkZXJfaWQ9OTAwODJ8dHlwZT1kZXZlbG9wZXJ8ZGF0ZT0yMDE2LTA5LTIwIDIxOjI0OjAz`

You will also need to install **ACF Columns** to properly place its fields in columns. 
Go to `Plugins` -> `Add new` and search for the plugin. 

Also install **Advanced Custom Fields: Image Crop Add-on** to be able to cut the uploaded images.
