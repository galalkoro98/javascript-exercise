WordPress is the most famous CMS (Content Management system) in the world! We say that more than 30% of the websites are made with WordPress. It actually showcases millions of businesses, bloggers and online shops. This popularity makes it an interesting tool for rapid deployment. Indeed, it is not uncommon that your client has already used WordPress, which has the advantage that he already knows his future tool.

Wordpress was originally a tool to create blogs. Each posted content is an article and pages are unique posts. The tool became versatile with time. We can also do everything we want with WordPress. If you can code, it’s possible to download plugins and design to make a stunning website. The only thing you have to do though is to change the texts, titles and pictures like on social media.

Before we start, let’s clarify something. WordPress is coded with PHP. If you don't know that language yet, that would be the perfect opportunity to learn. Let’s start, shall we ?
